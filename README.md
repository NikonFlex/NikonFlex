Here is a story of my interest in IT development that first appeared in June 2020.

At the start it was just a move, nothing special, of a curiosity without any particular involvement into the matter. But in a month time I suddenly decided to do my first project. My father gave me some basics, an introduction to computer project development. (He is a professional developer at a huge IT company).

Dad explained to me what the first steps should be to program and I followed his advice. I started with the basis of Python programming language. My father advised me to learn this language by creating games with the Pygame module. Practically on my own I developed some 10 games and this experience turned out to be very helpful. I thought they would hardly find any usage, but strangely my friends’ younger brothers and sisters enjoyed the games!

In May 2021 I moved on to learn something new and chose new programming language - C++. Fortunately, I got a friend who studied at the Naval Academy in my city; He and his team had an emulator, but not a handy one, allowing writing solution on a sheet of paper and then scanning it. The guys wanted something more comfortable and faster. I suggested to design an app that will simplify this painful process and they agreed. Then I developed a desktop app which could be used for creating different scenarios for the navigational emulator conveniently. They appreciated my work and I even got paid some money. It was my first experience in developing commercial project with a client and it was very fascinating and encouraging!

I also worked on a number of different projects on C# language with an amazing framework called WPF. For example, I tried to develop a desktop app with which you can create a picture by segments and my robot will draw it on paper with just one click! This project considerably improved my competence in project design and creating user-friendly interface. Also, I developed sort of a messenger; and it was also a success as my friends used it to chat with me.

However, WPF is not the only framework to create programs on C#. My mind jumped to the Unity framework. This is a 3D engine that helps creating cross-platform games or simulators. Luckily, my dad had extensive experience with this framework and I asked him to take part in my work. He agreed and we completed it successfully! Our project was a 3D simulator of a ship. It was used at the Naval Academy. It was my first experience with development in a team and I finally understood what a ‘clean code’ meant.

 

In summer of 2022, I started to learn web development. I decided to do it with the asp.NET Core framework. It was one of the most popular frameworks for the purpose and it was also based on C#. When I learned the basics of it, I decided to start a business. I got a friend who is keen on cryptocurrency trading and he came up with an idea to simplify the process of trading and sell the method that will do it. I suggested to make a Google sheet that will indicate current situation on crypto exchanges and he agreed that it would be much easier to trade with this table. To implement this idea I needed to develop a special API that would collect data from exchanges and fill it into special Google tables. I created this API and also a table pattern that my API requires to fill and it was a success. We sold many tables and earned some money on this project.

I am looking forward to continue my education, so that I will have more ideas and tools to become a first class developer.
