Hello for everyone! 
I'm 17 years old developer from Saint-Petersburg, Russia. Now, I'm living in Helsinki, Finland because of my father's work. I'm studying at school in 11th grade. In free time I very like to code. It helps me to relax and it improves my skill. I have already tried some popular frameworks (Qt, WPF, Unity) and they are interesting for me. Also, I know 3 languages (C#, C++, Python) and now I'm learning basis of Swift language. In my opinion, I have huge experience of programming for my age. I have tried to make a start-up, to make telegram and mail bots, to make apps with UI, simple games and even simulators. I think that my main advantage is that I can learn something new easily. For example, I needed to create something like an "asker" in a spreadsheet for updates from my API. It was possible only with google apps script and I learned basics of this language in 10 minutes and did this "asker" easily.
